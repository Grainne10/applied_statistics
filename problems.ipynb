    "This project begins with a look at the lady tasting tea, a randomised experiment devised by Ronald Fisher. In the experiment, the lady is given eight cups of tea, four prepared by adding milk first and four by adding tea first. The lady's task is to correctly identify the four cups prepared by one method or the other. The null hypothesis is that the subject has no real ability to distinguish between the preparation method of the teas. The test statistic is a count of the number of successful attempts to select the four cups prepared by a given method. The distribution of possible number of successes, assuming the null hypothesis is true, can be computed using the number of combinations.\n",
