    "This project begins with a look at the lady tasting tea, a randomised experiment devised by Ronald Fisher. In the experiment, the lady is given eight cups of tea, four prepared by adding milk first and four by adding tea first. The lady's task is to correctly identify the four cups prepared by one method or the other. The null hypothesis is that the subject has no real ability to distinguish between the preparation method of the teas. The test statistic is a count of the number of successful attempts to select the four cups prepared by a given method. The distribution of possible number of successes, assuming the null hypothesis is true, can be computed using the number of combinations.\n",

When you see something showing a statistically significant result, we really mean that there was enough evidence provided to reject a null hypothesis.

    "# Discussion on the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that the two bell-shaped curves overlap each other quite heavily, the difference is notable in the shift of the peaks. Both distributions on the histograms are centered around 1,  which is the true standard deviation of the standard normal distribution.  We can observe that the distribution of standard deviations calculated with `ddof=1` (sample standard deviation) is slightly shifted to the right compared to those calculated with `ddof=0` (population standard deviation) is slightly shifted to the left. \n",
    "The `ddof=0` distribution slightly shifted left shows the histogram peaks at around 0.95, showing that this tends to underestimate the true standard deviation for small samples. \n",
    "The `ddof=1` distributions are centred closer to 1, this is an unbiased estimator, because dividing by n-1 corrects for the lost degree of freedom.\n",
    "As discussed, ddof determines how many degrees of freedom are subtracted when  computing the stnadard deviation. Because the sample mean removes one degree of freedom, the `ddof=1` estimator divides by n-1 and therefore produces slighlty larger values than `ddof=0`, which divides by n. The histograms above illustrate this difference.\n",
    "The results are consistent with the empirical rule for normal distributions. We generated  samples with a true standard deviation of 1, we expect most of the data to fall within one standard deviation of the mean. The spread of the population should be centre around 1, the histogram confirms this: both distributions peak near 1. There is empirical evidence that the `ddof=1` estimator better reflects the true spread of the underlying population when the sample size is small."
